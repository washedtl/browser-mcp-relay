## Tool catalog

**70 tools total = 19 first-party (built into this relay) + 51 forwarded from [`browser-devtools-mcp`](https://github.com/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp).**

Both layers are merged into a single `tools/list` response, so to your MCP client they all just look like "tools the relay provides."

## Worked examples

Each example shows the raw JSON-RPC `tools/call` request your MCP client would send. Most clients (Claude Code, Cursor) wrap this in a higher-level "use tool X" UX — these payloads are useful when you're debugging or building your own client.

### `lighthouse_audit` — measure performance after a deploy

```jsonc
// Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "lighthouse_audit",
    "arguments": {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "formFactor": "desktop"
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Response (truncated)
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\n  \"url\": \"https://example.com\",\n  \"formFactor\": \"desktop\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"performance\": 0.99,\n    \"accessibility\": 0.92,\n    \"best-practices\": 1.0,\n    \"seo\": 0.91\n  }\n}"
    }]
  }
}
```

> Use it in CI to fail a deploy when Lighthouse drops below a threshold, or interactively when you want a one-line "is this page slow?" answer.

### `cookies_export` — save an authed session

```jsonc
// Request — capture only cookies that apply to amazon.com
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 8,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "cookies_export",
    "arguments": {
      "urls": ["https://www.amazon.com/"]
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Response (truncated)
{
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "[\n  { \"name\": \"session-id\", \"value\": \"<...>\", \"domain\": \".amazon.com\", \"path\": \"/\", \"httpOnly\": true, \"secure\": true, \"sameSite\": \"Lax\" },\n  { \"name\": \"ubid-main\", \"value\": \"<...>\", \"domain\": \".amazon.com\", ... }\n]"
    }]
  }
}
```

> Pair with `cookies_import` to restore the session later — useful for testing multi-step authed flows without re-logging in each run.

### `extract_structured` — scrape an authed page

```jsonc
// Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 9,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "extract_structured",
    "arguments": {
      "navigateToUrl": "https://example.com/product/123",
      "waitForSelector": "#productTitle",
      "schema": {
        "title":  { "selector": "#productTitle" },
        "price":  { "selector": "#priceblock" },
        "images": { "selector": "img.thumb", "attribute": "src", "multiple": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Response
{
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\n  \"title\": \"Example Product\",\n  \"price\": \"$19.99\",\n  \"images\": [\"https://.../1.jpg\", \"https://.../2.jpg\"]\n}"
    }]
  }
}
```

> Use this when a page is behind a login or a captcha that public scrapers can't bypass — your relay's Brave is already authenticated.

```

**How it works:**

- 📥 The relay receives MCP messages on stdin from your client.
- 📋 `tools/list` → merges the upstream's catalog with the 19 own-tool definitions and returns one combined list.
- ⚙️ `tools/call` → either forwards to the upstream child (for the 51 forwarded tools) or runs an own-tool handler directly.
- 🔌 Both paths attach to the same Brave instance: the upstream uses `BROWSER_CDP_CONNECT_URL`, own-tools use Playwright's `chromium.connectOverCDP` against the same port.
- 🪶 One Brave per relay process. Brave is launched **lazily on the first `tools/call`**, not at startup.

**Shutdown lifecycle (since v0.3.2):** orphan Brave processes are reaped at three points — `claimSlot` (lock-acquire), `ensureBrave` (pre-launch, `F1-16`), and `closeBrave` (shutdown via Playwright `context.close`). The pre-launch reap closes the lazy-launch gap where a previous-session Brave can squat on a claimed-but-not-yet-launched user-data-dir.

---

## Configuration

All paths the relay needs are auto-detected by default. Override them with these env vars or by editing `local-config.json` (gitignored, written by `npm run setup`).

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BROWSER_RELAY_BRAVE_PATH` | auto-detect | Absolute path to `brave` / `brave.exe`. Auto-detect probes Brave Stable / Beta / Nightly / Dev install paths on Win/Mac/Linux + the Windows registry (HKLM + HKCU, all 4 channels). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_UPSTREAM_PATH` | `require.resolve("browser-devtools-mcp/dist/index.js")` | Path to the upstream `browser-devtools-mcp` entry. Override to point at a custom build. |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_BRAVE_PROFILE_DIR` | unset | Optional profile dir hint used by detection / cookie snapshot. |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_DIR` | unset (standalone) | Opt-in: absolute path to a Brave user-data-dir to claim. Standalone mode uses `<repo>/.browser-data` (or a per-user cache dir if the repo is read-only — `~/.cache/browser-mcp-relay/browser-data` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches/browser-mcp-relay/browser-data` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\browser-mcp-relay\Cache\browser-data` on Windows). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_SLOT` | unset | Cosmetic slot index for the launch banner; also sets the CDP port (`9333 + slot - 1`) when using pool mode. |
| `BROWSER_HEADLESS_ENABLE` | `false` | Set `true` to launch Brave headless. |
| `BROWSER_LOAD_EXTENSIONS` | unset | Path to an unpacked Chrome extension to load. |
| `BROWSER_MCP_ROLE` | unset | Role-based slot filter (only meaningful with the optional pool wrapper). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_PROXY_URL` | unset | Optional HTTP proxy for Brave's outbound traffic. Useful with debug proxies (Charles, mitmproxy, powhttp). See [Proxy whitelist](#proxy-whitelist). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_VAULT_FILES` | unset (autofill disabled) | Path-delimiter-separated paths to Brave/Chrome password CSV exports (`;` on Win, `:` on POSIX). Enables form-autofill on navigation. See [Credential vault](#credential-vault--autofill). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_INDEXEDDB` | `false` | Include IndexedDB in pool-mode profile snapshot (100+ MB typical). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_INSPECTOR_PORT` | unset | When set, the relay boots the Inspector dashboard inline on this port and pipes its live MCP-traffic stream into the `/slot/N` Inspector pages. Without this, run the Inspector separately via `npm run inspector` (no live traffic). See [Inspector](#inspector). |
| `BROWSER_RELAY_INSPECTOR_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for the Inspector. Override only with care — the Inspector has no auth. |

**Precedence:** environment variable ▸ `local-config.json` ▸ auto-detect ▸ reasonable hard-coded defaults.

---

## Modes

### 🟢 Standalone (default)

One Brave per relay process. Profile stored at `<repo>/.browser-data` (or a per-user cache dir if the repo is read-only — see `BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_DIR` above for platform-specific paths). No cookie snapshot. Each `npm run setup` produces this configuration. **Recommended for first-time users.**

### 🔵 Pool (opt-in)

Set `BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_DIR` to an absolute path of a Brave user-data-dir to claim. Pool mode uses that single dir + the slot index from `BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_SLOT` for the launch banner + CDP port (`9333 + slot - 1`). **Useful when running multiple relay processes against pre-warmed Brave profiles** — each relay claims a different dir, each gets a deterministic port.

---

## How the pool dance actually works

If you run multiple Cursor windows simultaneously, each spawns its own relay, each claims a pool slot, each launches its own Brave. Here's the full dance — useful for understanding what you're seeing in the Inspector and for debugging restart hangs.

### State per slot

Each pool dir has up to three pieces of state:

| File / process | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<pool-dir>/.mcp-wrapper-lock` | Atomic lock file. JSON `{ pid, startedAt, host, relay: true }`. Created via `O_CREAT \| O_EXCL` (POSIX) or `wx` flag (Win). Mode `0o600` on POSIX so the file isn't world-readable. |
| `<pool-dir>/Default/...` | The actual Brave user-data — cookies, localStorage, history, etc. Read by every Brave attached to this dir. |
| Brave subtree | Main Brave process + 5–15 helper subprocesses (renderer / GPU / utility / crashpad), all with `--user-data-dir=<pool-dir>` in their command line. |

### Claim sequence (when a relay starts)

```
1. claimSlot() iterates pool dirs in order
2. For each candidate dir:
   a. mkdir -p <dir> (idempotent)
   b. If lock file exists:
      - Read lock JSON, isPidAlive(meta.pid)
      - If pid is dead → unlink stale lock, proceed
      - If pid is alive → skip this dir, try next
   c. fs.openSync(lockPath, "wx", 0o600) — atomic; if fails with EEXIST,
      another relay raced us; skip this dir, try next
   d. Write the lock contents + fdatasync
   e. reapOrphansFor(dir) — kills any Brave processes still pinned to
      this dir (which wouldn't have a parent — squatters from a previous
      session that closeBrave didn't cleanly tear down)
3. If we exhausted all dirs → throw "pool exhausted"
```

### First tool call (lazy launch)

The relay holds the lock but doesn't launch Brave at startup — only when the first `tools/call` arrives. At that point:

```
1. ensureBrave() runs
2. F1-16 (v0.3.2): pool.reapOrphansFor(dir) AGAIN — catches any orphan
   that appeared on this dir AFTER claim but BEFORE first tool call
   (lazy-launch gap; the bug that bit me on 2026-05-10)
3. launchBrave({ userDataDir: dir, port: 9333 + slot - 1, ... })
4. Brave subtree comes up; CDP endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:<port>
5. waitForCdpReady polls /json/version until 200 or timeout
6. attachAutofill listens on framenavigated for vault credentials
7. Subsequent tool calls reuse the same Brave instance
```

### Shutdown sequence

```
On SIGTERM / SIGINT / upstream-child-exit:
  1. shutdownAsync() — memoized so concurrent triggers all await one chain
  2. releasePool() FIRST — unlinks the lock so the slot is reclaimable
     (W1-6: if a second Ctrl-C interrupts mid-await, the slot is already
     freed)
  3. upstreamClient.close() — graceful TCP/stdio close
  4. killUpstreamTree() — taskkill /F /T on the upstream BDMCP node
     (G0-3: walks the subtree on Win; only the parent on POSIX, where
     reparenting is graceful)
  5. closeBrave(bridge) + inspectorHandle.close() in PARALLEL with per-
     step timeouts (8s / 3s) — G0-7 + G1-2: prevents one wedged step
     from blocking the whole shutdown
  6. process.exit(128 + signal-num)

On Windows TerminateProcess (force-quit Cursor, blue screen, power loss):
  - Only process.on("exit") fires → shutdownSync() runs
  - closeBrave(bridge).catch(() => {}) is fire-and-forget — Playwright's
    context.close is async; the process exits before it resolves
  - Brave is reparented to System; the next relay's claimSlot reaps it
```

### Why you might see N+1 relays vs N Cursor windows

Cursor's bundled `cursor-browser-devtools-mcp-vscode-0.6.3-universal` extension runs its OWN MCP — separate process tree, separate user-data-dir (`.browser-data-mcp`, no `-pool-N` suffix). Distinguish:

| Process | Identifier in `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` |
|---|---|
| **Your relay** | `node ...\.claude\scripts\browser-mcp-relay\src\index.js` — uses `.browser-data-mcp-pool-N` dirs |
| **Cursor's bundled MCP** | `node ...\.cursor\extensions\serkan-ozal.browser-devtools-mcp-vscode-...\node_modules\browser-devtools-mcp\dist\index.js --cursor-mcp-server` — uses `.browser-data-mcp` (no `-pool-` suffix) |

Both can be alive simultaneously. The relay's safety net (claim-time + pre-launch reap) only protects YOUR relay's pool dirs — Cursor's bundled MCP has its own lifecycle. If you only ever see Brave processes pinned to `.browser-data-mcp` (no `-pool-`), that's the bundled extension, not your relay.

---

## Optional features

### Proxy whitelist

Set `BROWSER_RELAY_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888` (or wherever your debug proxy listens) to route the relay's Brave traffic through an HTTP proxy you control. Combined with the relay's per-context `ignoreHTTPSErrors`, this lets you inspect the relay's HTTP traffic via Charles, mitmproxy, powhttp, etc. without affecting your main browser. Your system proxy stays untouched — only this launched Brave opts in.

> ⚠️ **Security:** Only point this at HTTP proxies you control on **localhost**. The relay accepts any TLS cert when a proxy is set (so MITM debug proxies "just work"), which means a hostile or compromised remote proxy can transparently MITM all of the relay's traffic — including pages you're authenticated to. If you don't fully control the proxy, leave this unset.

### Credential vault + autofill

The relay can auto-fill login forms when a saved credential matches the current page's hostname. **Off by default.** To enable:

1. Export passwords from Brave (or Chrome): `brave://settings/passwords` → "Export passwords" → save as CSV
2. Set `BROWSER_RELAY_VAULT_FILES=/absolute/path/to/passwords.csv` (path-delimiter-separated for multiple paths — `;` on Win, `:` on POSIX)
3. Restart the relay

The vault loads CSVs at startup, indexes by hostname + registrable domain, and fills the first empty username + password fields on each `framenavigated`. **It does not auto-submit** — you click submit yourself.

> ⚠️ **Security:** Passwords stay in memory only — never logged, never re-written. But anyone with read access to your relay process's memory could read them. Only point this at CSVs you trust. The vault is most useful when scraping authed sites that block Playwright's password manager (e.g. Brave 127+'s App-Bound Encryption).

---

## Inspector

A small web dashboard for peeking at the relay's runtime state — pool slot status (claimed / idle / orphan), cookie-source freshness, vault entry counts, tool counts, uptime, plus a per-slot **Inspector page** with live MCP-traffic streaming. **Off by default**, no auth, read-only.

![Inspector — Pool overview](./screenshots/01-pool-overview.png)

### Two modes

#### Standalone (no live traffic)

Start the Inspector separately. It still serves Pool / Tools / Activity / Settings / per-slot pages, but the **Activity feed on `/slot/N` will be empty** — there's no relay process to subscribe to.

```bash
npm run inspector
# Inspector running at http://127.0.0.1:9090
```

#### In-process (full live traffic)

Set `BROWSER_RELAY_INSPECTOR_PORT` in your MCP-client config (e.g. `~/.claude.json`) so the relay boots the Inspector inline. The Inspector then subscribes to the relay's traffic emitter and streams every `tools/call` request + response over a WebSocket to connected Inspector tabs.

```jsonc
// ~/.claude.json (excerpt)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-mcp-relay": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<absolute-path-to-repo>/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSER_RELAY_INSPECTOR_PORT": "9091"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After the next MCP connect, open `http://localhost:9091/slot/1` to see the per-slot Inspector page. The Activity feed populates in real time as your AI client makes tool calls.

### Pages

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pool overview** (`/`) — slot grid (claimed / idle / orphan), cookie-source freshness card, vault summary. Orphan slots get a **Reap** button that clears the stale lock + kills any leftover Brave processes holding that user-data-dir. | ![Pool overview](./screenshots/01-pool-overview.png) |
| **Slot detail** (`/slot/N`) — per-slot live activity feed (request → response cards, last 100), click any event to see request JSON + response + timing in the Detail card. Empty in standalone mode; live in in-process mode. | ![Slot detail](./screenshots/02-slot-detail.png) |
| **Tools catalog** (`/tools`) — all 70 tools (19 first-party + 51 forwarded), filter + per-tool detail | ![Tools catalog](./screenshots/03-tools-catalog.png) |
| **Activity history** (`/activity`) — cross-slot ring buffer of the last ~200 MCP tool calls, with filter pills (All / Requests / Responses / Errors) and time-range picker (5m / 1h / 24h). Empty in standalone mode. | ![Activity history](./screenshots/04-activity-history.png) |
| **Settings** (`/settings`) — resolved config, env-var booleans, paste-ready `local-config.json` snippet | ![Settings](./screenshots/06-settings.png) |

The only mutating endpoint (`POST /api/slots/N/reap`) requires a same-origin Origin header (or no Origin — the curl path); cross-origin POSTs are rejected with 403.

> ⚠️ **Security:** The inspector binds to **`127.0.0.1` only by default** and has **no authentication**. Only the local user can reach it. Anyone with shell access to your machine — or any process running locally — can read pool state, vault file paths, and tool counts. The WebSocket streams every `tools/call` request + response; in-process mode means *anyone with localhost access can see what your AI is doing in real time*. **Treat the inspector port as if it had your bearer tokens on it** — `tools/call` arguments routinely contain auth tokens, URLs of authed sessions, the cookies your AI is sending, etc. Don't expose it via SSH tunnels, ngrok, or `BROWSER_RELAY_INSPECTOR_BIND=0.0.0.0` unless you know what you're doing. **Kill the server when you're done** (Ctrl+C). Defenses in place: localhost-only bind, Origin allowlist on the WS upgrade and on every mutating POST, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking gate), `Cache-Control: no-store` on every API response, path-traversal hard stop, 64 KB WS frame cap + 1 MB back-pressure cap.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 🪟 **Windows** | ✅ First-class | Tested daily. PowerShell + registry probes for Brave detection (HKLM + HKCU, all 4 channels). |
| 🍎 **macOS** | 🟡 Best-effort | Code paths are written portably (`process-shim.js`, `detect-browser.js`) but not yet maintainer-verified. Bug reports welcome. |
| 🐧 **Linux** | 🟡 Best-effort | Honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for Brave profile detection + `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for the standalone-mode fallback dir. POSIX `kill -0` for liveness. Not yet maintainer-verified end-to-end. |

## Troubleshooting

### "Brave not found"

Auto-detect couldn't find Brave at any of the standard locations. Either:

- Install Brave from [brave.com](https://brave.com/), OR
- Set `BROWSER_RELAY_BRAVE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/brave` and re-run `npm run setup`

### "Cannot find module 'browser-devtools-mcp'"

The upstream MCP isn't installed. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

…or, if you want a custom upstream build, set `BROWSER_RELAY_UPSTREAM_PATH=/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js` and re-run setup.

### Smoke test fails: "tool count too low"

The relay started but returned fewer than 60 tools. Check the relay's stderr output for upstream-spawn errors, or the smoke script's stderr tail.

### "Tools appear in `tools/list` but `tools/call` hangs"

Brave didn't launch successfully. Common causes:

- **Another Brave instance is holding the user-data-dir lock** (orphan from a previous session). Since v0.3.2, the relay reaps these automatically before launch. If you're on an older version, check for `brave.exe` processes pinned to your relay's user-data-dir and `taskkill /F /T /PID <them>`.
- Missing display server (Linux headless without xvfb) — try `BROWSER_HEADLESS_ENABLE=true`.
- Insufficient permissions.

### Cursor or Claude Code hangs on close + reopen

Most cases: orphaned Brave from a previous session was squatting on a pool slot's user-data-dir. v0.3.2's `F1-16` pre-launch reap fixes this — the new relay reaps any squatter before launch. If you're seeing this on v0.3.2+, please file an issue with the output of:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='brave.exe'" | Where-Object {
  $_.CommandLine -match 'browser-data-mcp'
} | Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, CommandLine
```

### Multiple relays from one machine

Each relay process needs its own user-data-dir. Use pool mode (`BROWSER_RELAY_POOL_DIR=/path/to/dir`, different per process) or run each relay in its own checkout.

## Diagnostic recipes

Drop-in PowerShell snippets for poking around when something feels off. All of these are **read-only** — they observe state without modifying anything. None require the Inspector to be running.

### Find orphan Brave subtrees pinned to a relay pool dir

The classic "Cursor restart hangs" symptom. Run this in PowerShell BEFORE reopening Cursor — anything returned is an orphan that the next relay's pre-launch reap (F1-16) should clean up automatically on v0.3.2+. Older relays will hang on launch.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='brave.exe'" | Where-Object {
  $_.CommandLine -match 'browser-data-mcp' -and -not (Get-Process -Id $_.ParentProcessId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
} | Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, @{
  N='Dir'; E={ if($_.CommandLine -match '--user-data-dir=("?)([^"]+?)\1'){$Matches[2]} }
}
```

Empty output = no orphans. Anything else = list of `(PID, dead-parent-PID, dir)` triples. Manual cleanup if needed: `taskkill /F /T /PID <orphan-main-pid>`.

### Inventory all Brave processes by pool dir

When you want to see which slots are actually in use vs. just lock-claimed.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='brave.exe'" | ForEach-Object {
  $dir = if ($_.CommandLine -match '--user-data-dir=("?)([^"]+?)\1') { $Matches[2] } else { '<unknown>' }
  $type = if ($_.CommandLine -match '--type=(\w+)') { $Matches[1] } else { 'main' }
  [PSCustomObject]@{ PID = $_.ProcessId; PPID = $_.ParentProcessId; Type = $type; Dir = $dir }
} | Group-Object Dir | Select-Object Name, Count | Sort-Object Name
```

### Show the live state of every pool slot lock

Which pool slots have valid locks vs. stale ones. The relay self-heals stale locks at next claim, but it's useful to see them yourself.

```powershell
1..16 | ForEach-Object {
  $lock = "$env:USERPROFILE\.browser-data-mcp-pool-$_\.mcp-wrapper-lock"
  if (Test-Path $lock) {
    $meta = Get-Content $lock | ConvertFrom-Json
    $alive = $null -ne (Get-Process -Id $meta.pid -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Slot = $_; PID = $meta.pid; Alive = $alive; Held = $meta.startedAt }
  }
} | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

### Check whether a relay is actually responding

If `tools/call` is hanging, this confirms whether the relay's CDP endpoint is reachable. Replace the port with the slot's CDP port (`9333 + slot - 1`).

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:9333/json/version" -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode, @{
  N='Browser'; E={ ($_.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).Browser }
}
```

200 + a Brave version → CDP is healthy; relay is responsive. Connection refused → Brave isn't running. Hangs → Brave is wedged (renderer crash, etc.) — `taskkill /F /T /PID <main-brave-pid>` and restart Cursor.

### Confirm which Cursor MCP is which

When you see 12+ MCP-related node processes alive simultaneously and want to distinguish "your relay" from "Cursor's bundled extension":

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='node.exe'" | Where-Object {
  $_.CommandLine -match 'browser-mcp-relay|browser-devtools-mcp'
} | Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, @{
  N='Identity'; E={
    if ($_.CommandLine -match 'browser-mcp-relay') { 'YOUR relay' }
    elseif ($_.CommandLine -match 'cursor-mcp-server') { 'Cursor bundled' }
    else { '<unknown>' }
  }
} | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

### Tail the relay's stderr from the inspector log file

The relay writes diagnostic stderr lines (autofill events, CDP errors, shutdown traces). Cursor swallows them; the inspector's in-process mode captures them in memory but doesn't persist them. For long-running diagnosis, redirect the relay's stderr to a file by tweaking your MCP-client config:

```jsonc
// ~/.claude.json (excerpt) — adds stderr file capture
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-mcp-relay": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<absolute-path>/src/index.js"],
      "stderr": "<absolute-path>/relay-stderr.log"
    }
  }
}
```

Then `Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE/.claude/scripts/browser-mcp-relay/relay-stderr.log -Tail 50 -Wait` to follow it live.

## Limitations

- 📜 Upstream `browser-devtools-mcp` is licensed **Elastic-2.0** — permissive but **not OSI-approved-open-source**. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the full breakdown.
- 🦁 Requires **Brave** installed locally. Other Chromium browsers may work via `BROWSER_RELAY_BRAVE_PATH` but are untested.
- 🍪 **Standalone mode does not snapshot cookies** from another profile — first run hits login walls. Cookie snapshot is a pool-mode feature.
- 🧍 **One Brave per relay process.** To run multiple Brave sessions in parallel, run multiple relays (each on its own slot / profile dir).
- 🔐 **3 low-severity transitive `cookie<0.7.0` advisories** via `lighthouse → @sentry/node`. Fix requires `lighthouse@13`, which is a breaking dep upgrade for our `^11.0.0` pin. Tracked; not exploitable in practice for a localhost-bound dev tool. Run `npm audit` to see them; `npm audit fix --force` would resolve at the cost of a major-version upgrade.
